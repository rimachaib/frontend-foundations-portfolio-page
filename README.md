# frontend-foundations-portfolio-page
This responsive portfolio webpage written in HTML and CSS was created to fulfill the assignment requirements for Thinkful's Engineering Flex Program's "Front-End Foundations Lesson".  This assignment allowed me to practice implementing conceptual knowledge from the lesson.  The primary concepts I learned, that I was able to apply, to this web page inlcuded the following:
- Create a page layout using flexbox.
- Implement appropriate media queries for responsive design.
- Follow a mobile-first development approach.
- Use responsive navigation.
